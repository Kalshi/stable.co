                        “I bought hurricane tickets last year to help cover my deductibles. We all know Florida is a
                        great
                        state
                        to live in but the hurricanes really can fuck you over. It started as a slow season but
                        September
                        came
                        around and Ian came straight at us… I evacuated because I’m not one to play with fate. As
                        soon as
                        Ian
                        was declared to hit Fort Myers as a category 4 hurricane I saw my payout made available in
                        the
                        website
                        and proceeded to withdraw. Had the money in my bank account next day and used it to pay for
                        hotels,
                        food, and also a lot of damage we had in our house and garden. We are on a tight budget
                        since my
                        husband
                        lost his job and I really don’t think we’d have been able to manage this so well without
                        these
                        hurricane
                        tickets. I’m definitely buying them again this year!”

                        been god trying to help our family out… As soon as it hit $5 I got my payout and the support
                        folks
                        were very nice helping me withdraw the payout. My tickets paid out 20x, and I got around $1000
                        to
                        help my family with gas costs. Will keep using this service. You never know what can happen.”

                If you buy 5 tickets for Charleston (a 17x payout), you’d receive $4,250 for your initial $250
                purchase. These tickets are made possible by an underlying, regulated market run by Kalshi, Inc.

                        “I bought hurricane tickets last year to help cover my deductibles. We all know Florida is a
                        great
                        state
                        to live in but the hurricanes really can fuck you over. It started as a slow season but
                        September
                        came
                        around and Ian came straight at us… I evacuated because I’m not one to play with fate. As
                        soon as
                        Ian
                        was declared to hit Fort Myers as a category 4 hurricane I saw my payout made available in
                        the
                        website
                        and proceeded to withdraw. Had the money in my bank account next day and used it to pay for
                        hotels,
                        food, and also a lot of damage we had in our house and garden. We are on a tight budget
                        since my
                        husband
                        lost his job and I really don’t think we’d have been able to manage this so well without

                        hurricane

            If you live in a hurricane-prone area, you know how nerve-wracking it can be when a storm is brewing. Your
            home is your sanctuary, and you want to make sure it can stand up to the wrath of Mother Nature. So, let's
            dive into five laid-back, yet crucial, steps you can take to minimize hurricane damage and keep your house
            in tip-top shape.
        </p>
        <p class="heading10 px16">
            1. Beef Up Your Home's Strength
        </p>
        <p class="px16">
            First things first, let's talk about reinforcing your home's structure. Take a stroll around your property
            and give it a good once-over.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Top-Notch Roof: Make sure your roof is in good shape and properly anchored to the rest of
                your house.
                Consider adding hurricane straps or clips for extra security.</li>
            <li>Window and Door Love: Install impact-resistant windows and doors if you can swing it. If
                not, invest in
                sturdy hurricane shutters. Also, give those doors and windows a good seal to keep water out.</li>
            <li>Walls That Stand Tall: Strengthen your exterior walls with some bracing. Ensure that your
                siding or
                masonry
                is firmly attached to the frame.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="heading10 px16">
            2. Get Elevation-Savvy
        </p>
        <p class="px16">
            If you're in an area prone to flooding, it's time to think about lifting your house. Elevating your home can
            save you a lot of headache (and heartache) when the waters rise.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Pilings or Stilts: Consider lifting your home up on pilings or stilts. It'll keep it above the
                floodwaters. Make
                sure you're following local elevation regulations.</li>
            <li>Flood Vents: These nifty vents in your foundation walls let floodwater flow through, taking the pressure
                off
                your home's structure.</li>
        </ul>




        <p class="heading10 px16">
            3. Batten Down the Hatches
        </p>
        <p class="px16">
            You know those outdoor items that make your home feel cozy and inviting? Well, during a hurricane, they can
            turn
            into flying projectiles. So, secure or stow away stuff like patio furniture, grills, and garden decorations.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Trim Those Trees: Give your trees a trim to minimize the risk of falling branches or even whole trees
                during a
                storm.</li>
        </ul>






        <p class="heading10 px16">
            4. Craft a Hurricane Game Plan
        </p>
        <p class="px16">
            Having a plan in place is like having a superhero cape for your family. It's your hurricane preparedness
            plan,
            and it's vital for your safety and your home's well-being.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Evacuation Strategy: Know your escape routes and destinations. When authorities say "go," be ready to
                roll.</li>
            <li>Emergency Kit: Gather up a stash of essentials – food, water, flashlights, batteries, first aid gear,
                and
                important documents. Think of it as your hurricane survival kit.</li>
            <li>Stay Connected: Arrange a communication plan with your family so you can stay in touch during the storm.
                Get a
                battery-powered or hand-crank radio for weather updates.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="heading10 px16">
            5. Insure for the Unexpected
        </p>
        <p class="px16">
            Standard homeowners' insurance usually doesn't cover flood damage. So, make sure you're protected
            financially by getting flood insurance from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) or a private
            insurer. You can also buy Rainy Day Market hurricane tickets to help cover some of the costs and damage
            associated with a hurricane. The tickets are paid out immediately after a hurricane happens so you can use
            those funds to cover deductibles, whatever damages your insurance doesn’t cover, evacuation costs, and so
            on.
        </p>
        <p class="px16">
            Your home is more than just bricks and beams; it's where memories are made. Taking these easygoing steps to
            hurricane-proof your house can give you peace of mind and ensure it stands strong when a storm rolls in. So,
            kick back, relax, and know that you've got your home's back, rain or shine!

        <p class="heading30">
            What is "storm surge" and how can you protect your home from it?
        </p>
        <p class="px16">
            Storm surge is a sudden and abnormal rise in sea level during a hurricane or tropical storm, resulting from
            the combination of strong onshore winds and low atmospheric pressure. It is one of the most dangerous and
            potentially deadly aspects of a hurricane, as it can cause widespread coastal flooding and pose a
            significant threat to life and property. Storm surge can inundate coastal areas, including homes and
            infrastructure, leading to devastating consequences.

            Here's how storm surge works and some ways to protect your home from it:

        </p>
        <p class="heading10 px16">
            1. How Storm Surge Works
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wind and Pressure: Storm surge occurs when strong winds from a hurricane push water toward the coast.
                The low atmospheric pressure in the storm's center also contributes to the rise in sea level. These two
                factors combine to create a dome of water that moves ashore.</li>
            <li>Topography: The shape of the coastline and the underwater features of the seabed can amplify or mitigate
                the effects of storm surge. Narrow bays, shallow coastal areas, and inlets can experience more
                significant surges.</li>
            <li>Timing: Storm surge typically occurs before the hurricane's center makes landfall, meaning that coastal
                areas can experience flooding well in advance of the storm's strongest winds and rain.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="heading10 px16">
            2. How to Protect Your Home from Storm Surge
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Evacuate if Advised: The most critical step is to heed evacuation orders issued by local authorities.
                If you're in an area at risk of storm surge, leave your home and seek higher ground.</li>
            <li>Elevate Your Home: If you live in a hurricane-prone area, consider elevating your home on pilings or
                stilts to reduce the risk of flood damage. Building codes in many coastal regions require elevated
                construction in vulnerable areas.</li>
            <li>Flood Barriers and Seals: Install flood barriers, flood panels, or watertight seals around doors and
                windows to prevent water from entering your home.
            </li>
            <li>Reinforce Your Foundation: Ensure that your home's foundation is strong and well-anchored to withstand
                the force of floodwaters. Reinforce it with pilings or other flood-resistant construction methods.
            </li>
            <li>Elevate Utilities: Elevate electrical systems, HVAC units, and other utilities to prevent water damage
                and electrical hazards during a flood.
            </li>
            <li>Storm Shutters: Install storm shutters or impact-resistant windows to protect against wind-driven
                debris.</li>
            <li>Secure Outdoor Items: Secure or bring inside outdoor furniture, grills, and other items that could
                become projectiles in high winds.</li>
            <li>Trim or remove dead, damaged, or rotting trees and limbs: The high winds that sometimes happen with
                storm surges can cause tree branches or whole trees to fall. To be fully safe, you should make sure that
                your home is at least one tree length away from the nearest tree</li>
            <li>Reinforce the garage door: Purchase reinforced garage doors that can withstand the force of water to
                help prevent water going into your home.</li>
            <li>Seal cracks and gaps: This will help prevent water from getting into your home. Make sure to use
                waterproof sealant! Also make sure to seal all windows.</li>
            <li>Flood Insurance: Purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) or a
                private insurer. Standard homeowners' insurance policies typically do not cover flood damage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="px16 body30">Remember that storm surge is a life-threatening event, and property can often be
            replaced, but
            lives cannot. Always prioritize your safety and the safety of your family by following evacuation orders and
            seeking shelter in a safe location during a hurricane with the potential for storm surge. Also make sure you
            have an emergency kit and an emergency plan in place.


        </p>
        <p class="px16 body30"> Rainy Day Market’s hurricane tickets help you get immediately accessible funds in case
            of a storm surge
            because of a hurricane. You can use the payouts from the ticket (which you’ll get immediately!) to cover any
            evacuation costs, deductibles, emergency costs and so on.</p>

            What will happen to your home at different hurricane categories?
        </p>
        <p class="px16">
            The impact of a hurricane on a home structure can vary significantly depending on the hurricane's category,
            the construction of the home, its location, and other factors. Here's a general overview of what can happen
            to home structures when they're hit by hurricanes of different categories:

        </p>
        <p class="heading10 px16">
            Category 1 (74-95 mph) - Minimal Damage:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Well-built homes may experience minimal damage, such as loose roof shingles, siding, or minor flooding.
            </li>
            <li>Poorly constructed or older homes may sustain more significant damage, including roof damage and some
                structural damage.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="heading10 px16">
            Category 2 (96-110 mph) - Moderate Damage:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Well-built homes can still withstand this category with some damage to roofs, windows, and doors.</li>
            <li>Older or poorly constructed homes may experience more extensive damage, including roof failure and
                potential structural damage.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="heading10 px16">Category 3 (111-129 mph) - Extensive Damage:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Even well-built homes are likely to experience significant damage, including roof and structural damage.
            </li>
            <li>Mobile homes can be completely destroyed.Mobile homes can be completely destroyed.</li>
            <li>Flooding can be a major concern, especially in coastal areas.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="heading10 px16">Category 4 (130-156 mph) - Severe Damage:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Well-built homes may still experience severe damage, including roof failure and structural damage.</li>
            <li>Many older or weaker structures can be destroyed.</li>
            <li>Widespread flooding is a significant threat.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="heading10 px16">Category 5 (157 mph or higher) - Catastrophic Damage:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Homes, even well-constructed ones, can be completely destroyed, leaving only the foundation.</li>
            <li>Widespread and catastrophic flooding is almost certain in coastal areas.</li>
            <li>Debris and projectiles from high winds can cause additional damage to structures.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="px16 body30">It's important to note that the specific impact of a hurricane can also be influenced by
            factors such as storm surge, the angle of approach, the terrain, and the quality of construction materials
            and methods used in the home. Building codes and regulations in hurricane-prone areas often require homes to
            be designed and constructed to withstand the forces of hurricanes to varying degrees, with stricter
            standards in higher-risk areas.


        </p>
        <p class="px16 body30"> Residents in hurricane-prone regions are advised to have hurricane preparedness plans in
            place, including reinforcing their homes where possible, securing loose objects, and having an evacuation
            plan in case the storm threatens their safety. Additionally, listening to local authorities and heeding
            evacuation orders is crucial for personal safety during a hurricane event. </p>

        <p class="px16 body30"> Rainy Day Market’s hurricane tickets were created to help you bridge the gap between the
            costs you incur when a hurricane hits and your insurance: you can use it to help cover your deductibles,
            emergency evacuation costs, among other things. The tickets have an immediate payout, so you’ll have access
            to your funds as soon as the hurricane is confirmed.</p>

        <p class="px16">
            Gas prices can fluctuate due to a variety of factors, both on a global and local scale. These factors can
            interact with each other, leading to complex and sometimes rapid changes in gas prices. Here are some of the
            key factors that influence gas prices:

        </p>
        <p class="heading10 px16">
            1. Crude Oil Prices
        </p>

        <p class="body30 px16">
            The most significant factor in determining gas prices is the cost of crude oil, as
            gasoline is refined from crude oil. Global supply and demand for crude oil play a major role in its pricing.
            Events such as geopolitical conflicts, production cuts by oil-producing countries (OPEC), and changes in
            global oil production can all impact crude oil prices.
        </p>


        <p class="heading10 px16">
            2. Supply and Demand
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            The basic principle of supply and demand applies to gas prices. When demand for gasoline is high (e.g.,
            during
            the summer travel season), and supply is limited, prices tend to rise. Conversely, when demand is low, or
            there's an oversupply of gasoline, prices may fall.
        </p>


        <p class="heading10 px16">
            3. Refining Costs and Capacity
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            Gasoline must be refined from crude oil, and disruptions or maintenance at refineries can affect supply.
            Additionally, the refining process itself can be affected by various factors, including changes in
            environmental
            regulations and the availability of specific refining capacity.
        </p>


        <p class="heading10 px16">
            4. Taxes
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            Federal, state, and local taxes can significantly impact gas prices. These taxes vary from one location to
            another and can change over time due to legislative decisions.
        </p>


        <p class="heading10 px16">
            5. Exchange Rates
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            Since oil is traded globally in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in exchange rates can impact the cost of oil
            imports,
            which can, in turn, affect gas prices.
        </p>


        <p class="heading10 px16">
            6. Transportation and Distribution Costs
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            The cost of transporting gasoline from refineries to gas stations can vary due to factors such as fuel
            efficiency, labor costs, and infrastructure maintenance.
        </p>


        <p class="heading10 px16">
            7. Weather Events
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            Natural disasters, hurricanes, and extreme weather can disrupt oil production, refining, and distribution,
            leading to temporary spikes in gas prices, especially in regions directly affected by these events.
        </p>


        <p class="heading10 px16">
            8. Speculation
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            Financial markets and speculative trading in oil futures can influence oil prices. Traders and investors
            often
            react to news and events that may or may not have a direct impact on the actual supply and demand of oil.
        </p>


        <p class="heading10 px16">
            9. Government Policies
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            Government policies and regulations, such as emissions standards and fuel economy requirements, can
            influence
            the type of gasoline produced and the overall supply and demand for different types of fuel.
        </p>


        <p class="heading10 px16">
            10. Competition
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            Gasoline prices can also be influenced by local competition among gas stations. In areas with more gas
            stations,
            prices may be lower due to competition, whereas in more remote areas with limited options, prices may be
            higher.
        </p>

        <p class="body30 px16"> It's important to note that these factors can vary in importance depending on the region
            and time frame you're considering. Gas prices can be highly volatile and subject to rapid changes due to a
            combination of these factors. Additionally, the interplay between global and local factors can make
            predicting gas price movements complex.</p>

        <p class="heading30">
            Why are gas prices going up right now?
        </p>
        <p class="px16">
            As we hit the summer of 2023, consumers across the globe are feeling the heat in more ways than one,
            especially at the gas pump. Gas prices have been on a rollercoaster ride, and the reasons behind these
            fluctuations are as diverse as the factors influencing our world today.

        </p>
        <p class="heading10 px16">
            Global Players: Saudi Arabia, China, and OPEC
        </p>

        <p class="body30 px16">
            At the forefront of the recent gas price surge is Saudi Arabia, often recognized as the world's largest oil
            exporter. In a strategic move, the kingdom announced a substantial reduction in oil production, slashing at
            least 1 million barrels per day through July. This decision follows the lead of the Organization of the
            Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which, in April, declared a cut of 1.6 million barrels per day in
            global
            oil production.
        </p>

        <p class="body30 px16">
            OPEC, a coalition of major oil-producing nations, including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, and Nigeria,
            collectively wields considerable influence, supplying approximately 40% of the world's crude oil. Their
            goal? To elevate the price of oil by limiting its global supply, effectively using their dominance to
            manipulate prices. Recently, OPEC extended its production cuts by an additional 1.4 million barrels per day,
            maintaining this strategy through the end of 2024.
        </p>

        <p class="body30 px16">
            In tandem with these global maneuvers, China's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is another critical
            factor. After enforcing some of the world's strictest lockdown measures since 2020, China began reopening
            its doors in late 2022. However, logistical challenges, such as expensive international flights and visa
            reinstatement delays, have slowed the process. As China's 1.4 billion citizens gradually return to their
            daily routines, experts anticipate heightened demand for fuel, inevitably contributing to rising gas prices.
        </p>

        <p class="body30 px16">
            Other influences in the mix include inflation, geopolitical tensions such as the U.S. ban on Russian oil
            imports due to the conflict in Ukraine, and the onset of summer, which traditionally boosts travel and road
            trips, further amplifying fuel demand.
        </p>


        <p class="heading10 px16">
            The Heat Is On: Extreme Weather Impact
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            Adding to this complex equation is the relentless wave of extreme heat blanketing the nation. This scorching
            weather isn't just about discomfort; it's affecting the very infrastructure of our energy supply. AAA
            estimates
            that extreme heat has forced the shutdown of 500,000 barrels per day of refining capacity this summer.
            Petroleum
            engineers reveal that when temperatures hover around 100 degrees Fahrenheit, running refineries at maximum
            capacity becomes exceedingly challenging.
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            Furthermore, the heat dome responsible for these sweltering conditions in the southern United States is
            expected
            to expand its grip across more of the central part of the country in the coming weeks, potentially
            exacerbating
            the strain on energy infrastructure.

            Stormy Seas: Hurricane Season Arrives
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            As if extreme heat weren't enough, the annual hurricane season has made its entrance, introducing another
            layer
            of uncertainty into the energy equation. Hurricane Hilary, though downgraded to a tropical storm, recently
            made
            landfall, impacting southern California, Nevada, and Arizona. However, it's not just the storms themselves
            but
            also the heightened risk they bring that is concerning. NOAA forecasters have increased the likelihood of an
            above-normal Atlantic hurricane season from 30% in May to 60% this month.
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            The U.S. remains particularly vulnerable to supply disruptions in the event of a significant storm striking
            between Corpus Christi, Texas, and the Beaumont-Port Arthur, Texas, coastline, an area home to numerous
            refineries.
        </p>

        <p class="body30 px16">
            In conclusion, gas prices are currently navigating a perfect storm of factors. From global power plays
            involving
            Saudi Arabia and OPEC to China's recovery, extreme heatwaves, and the unpredictability of hurricane season,
            consumers are left to grapple with the consequences at the pump. As we move forward into the summer months,
            it's
            clear that understanding the dynamics behind these price fluctuations will be more critical than ever for
            consumers and industries alike.

            Can you predict if gas prices are going to go up or down in the next month?
        </p>
        <p class="px16">
            Predicting the precise movement of gas prices is really hard because it depends on various complex factors,
            including global oil markets, geopolitical events, and economic conditions. However, there are some
            strategies and indicators that can help you predict what’s going to happen with your fuel costs:

        </p>
        <p class="heading10 px16">
            Track Crude Oil Prices
        </p>

        <p class="body30 px16">
            Crude oil prices have a direct impact on gasoline costs. Monitoring these prices by regularly checking
            reliable
            financial news websites, using mobile apps that provide real-time oil price updates, or setting up price
            alerts
            for significant changes can help you predict what’s going to happen to the price of gas. Usually if oil
            prices
            go up, gas prices are quick to follow!
        </p>


        <p class="heading10 px16">
            Analyze Supply and Demand
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            Understand the balance between oil supply and demand. Keep an eye on global oil production figures, events
            affecting oil-producing regions, and shifts in demand patterns. Look for trends or sudden changes that could
            signal potential price shifts. You can also do this at a local level: are you seeing more tourists in your
            town?
            Are you seeing any signs that more people will want to buy gas close to you?
        </p>

        <p class="heading10 px16">
            Seasonal Patterns
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            Recognize the seasonal trends in gas prices. Typically, prices rise during the summer months due to
            increased
            travel and drop during the winter when demand lessens. Consider how these patterns might affect next month's
            prices.
        </p>

        <p class="heading10 px16">
            Stay Informed About Geopolitics
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            Keep up with geopolitical events that could disrupt oil supplies or affect major oil-producing countries.
            Conflicts, sanctions, or political instability can lead to supply disruptions and higher oil prices. Usually
            these make major news, so you’ll probably read about this in social media or your favorite news TV show.
        </p>

        <p class="heading10 px16">
            Economic Indicators
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            Pay attention to economic indicators such as inflation rates, exchange rates, and overall economic health. A
            strong economy often leads to greater oil demand, while economic downturns can reduce it.
        </p>

        <p class="heading10 px16">
            Government Policies and Regulations
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            Research any upcoming government policy changes or regulatory shifts that could influence oil prices. Tax
            adjustments, emissions standards, and energy-related policies can all have an impact.

            Factor in weather-related events, particularly if you're in an area prone to hurricanes or other natural
            disasters. These events can disrupt oil production and refining, causing temporary price spikes.
        </p>

        <p class="heading10 px16">
            Consult Energy Reports
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            Utilize energy market reports and forecasts provided by organizations like the U.S. Energy Information
            Administration (EIA) or the International Energy Agency (IEA). These reports offer valuable insights into
            market

        <p class="heading30">
            Why do all the gas stations in my town have the same price day to day? Do they have a meeting or what?
        </p>
        <p class="px16">
            So, you might have noticed that gas stations in your town often seem to have eerily similar prices, like
            they're all in cahoots or something. But don't worry, they're not having secret meetings to coordinate their
            prices. There's actually a bunch of everyday reasons why gas prices tend to be pretty close among different
            stations in the same area.

        </p>
        <p class="heading10 px16">
            Competition
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            First off, gas stations are like hawks when it comes to checking out what their neighbors
            are charging. If one station drops its prices, you can bet your bottom dollar that others nearby will
            follow suit. And when one station decides to hike up prices, you guessed it, their competitors might
            just do the same to rake in more profit. It's all about trying to get you to pull into their pumps.
        </p>

        <p class="heading10 px16">
            Market Dynamics
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            Then there's the whole supply and demand thing. Gas prices can be influenced by factors
            like how much gas is available, what it costs to get it to the station, and taxes slapped on top. These
            factors usually hit all the stations in the area in pretty much the same way, so you'll see uniform
            price changes.
        </p>


        <p class="heading10 px16">
            Consumer Behavior
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            We're creatures of habit, right? Most of us tend to go for the nearest or cheapest
            gas station. That's why stations close to each other often keep their prices competitive. They know
            you're looking for the best deal and don't want you to drive past their place.
        </p>


        <p class="heading10 px16">
            Franchise Agreements
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            Some gas stations belong to bigger franchises or chains. These guys might have set
            pricing rules for all their locations, which can make prices look the same across the board.
        </p>


        <p class="heading10 px16">
            Regulations
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            Lastly, there are those pesky rules and agreements in some places that stop gas stations
            from going all-out price war on each other. These rules help keep things stable in the area.
        </p>

        <p class="body30 px16">

            But here's the kicker – there are some extra factors you might want to keep an eye out for. For instance,
            some gas stations have convenience stores on-site, and these are responsible for most of their profits. To
            get you in the door, they might price their gas a bit lower. Also, the brand of gas can make a difference.
            Exxon might be pricier than Shell, but if you're getting a higher-quality fuel, it could be worth the extra
            cents. And don't forget, if you're driving between cities, different places often have different
            regulations, which can mean you see a difference in the price tag.

        </p>

        <p class="body30 px16">
            So, while gas stations aren't secretly plotting to squeeze every last cent out of your pocket, it's still
            smart to shop around. Small differences can pop up, and you might just stumble upon a station with a few
            cents off the gallon, which can add up over time. Happy fueling!

        <p class="px16">
            You’ve probably heard of the Rainy Day Market hurricane tickets by now… So what is the fuss all about? Here
            are the top reasons us (a lot of people) are stocking up on these for the next hurricane season.

            1. Get actual cash the next day
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            We’ve all been there: emergency plan, evacuation, loss of electricity, house damage. The hit on the family
            budget is immense, and most of these costs aren’t covered by insurance. The hurricane tickets pay out
            immediately after the hurricane hits and you can use the cash for any expenses you have. You get the cash
            and it’s up to you and your family on where to allocate it: from food lost cause of electricity and hotel
            stay, to just adding it to your savings account if you (thankfully!) didn’t have any costs.
        </p>

        <p class="heading10 px16">

        <p class="body30 px16">
            Deductibles are getting higher and higher, and paying the deductibles is very painful and can ruin your
            family’s budget. A lot of folks are buying the Hurricane tickets to bridge the gap between your actual
            expenses and what insurance actually covers. As Madeline White from Miami says “I’ve been using Aflac for

            The tickets are $25 each so you can fit the number of tickets to you and your family needs. You can also buy
            these tickets at any point in time, directly on the Rainy Day Market website, without having to talk to
            anyone, wait for a quote or anything like that. Of course, the price might be different at different times,
            but the option to buy is always there!

            4. Backed by a federally regulated institution
        </p>
        <p class="body30 px16">
            I know: giving money to a new website can be scary. However, Rainy Day Market is as safe as it gets. In the
            background, they’re powered by a federally regulated financial market. The money to payout every ticket
            bought is safeguarded in a segregated bank account only used to payout these tickets.
